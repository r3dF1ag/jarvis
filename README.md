# jarvis
virtual assistant
I am thinking we could create a file wjich takes in contacts from google account, so that instead of having to manually key in the contact in the cosole, you can just say who to send the message to.
same applies to email
later on we could write an ai that monitors what you request arvis to do oftenly so that on startup, it does those things for us.
